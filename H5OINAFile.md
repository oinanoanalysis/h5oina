This document details the specification for the Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis HDF5 file format (_.h5oina_).
It is using the [Hierarchical Data Format 5](http://www.hdfgroup.org) file format library, which has several implementations in different programming languages.
The file format is largely influenced by the H5EBSD file format developed by Jackson et al. (2014) [[doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2193-9772-3-4)].
More details about the guiding principles used in the design of this file format and its scope of use within the microanalysis community can be found in this M&M abstract [[doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621006103)].

This file format can be used to export:
 - Electron images
 - EDS maps
 - EDS line scans
 - EBSD maps
 - EBSD line scans
 - Combined EDS/EBSD maps
 - Combined EDS/EBSD line scans
 - Processed or unprocessed EBSPs
 - Particle analysis data.

## <a name="general-notes"></a> General Notes

- All datasets containing physical quantities have an attribute *Unit* specifying the unit of the values. Note that this does not imply that different units might be use for a given dataset. The *Unit* attribute is only a hint to allow users to know the unit used in the dataset.
- All angles are expressed in _Radians_.
- Euler angles follow the Bunge convention ZXZ, i.e. +Z  +X'  +Z''.
- Each dataset defining Euler angles contains three columns, one for each Euler angle.
- All datasets and attributes of type H5T_STRING are encoded as UTF8 (see [H5T_CSET_UTF8](https://confluence.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5T_SET_CSET)).
- Each dataset defining color(s) contains three columns for the red, green and blue components.
- An _.h5oina_ file may not contain all the datasets specified in this specification. Different hardware and acquisition conditions mean that some parameters are not available, and therefore cannot be exported. The mandatory datasets are indicated below.
- In the Data datasets, the value of pixels outside the acquisition area is set to `NaN`.
- Some datasets use LZF compression. See [HDF5 Filter Plugins](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/HDF5+Filter+Plugins) and [LZF Compression Filter for HDF5](http://www.h5py.org/lzf/) for more information. :label: New in version 5.0

## <a name="data-tree"></a> AZtec Project Data Tree

Here is how the AZtec data are exported to _.h5oina_.
An AZtec project is normally structured using _Specimen_ and _Site_.
A _Site_ may contain one or more acquisitions like ED spectra, ED mappings, EDS mappings, EBSD mappings, electron images, etc.
If the user decides to export the whole project to _.h5oina_, an _.h5oina_ file would be created for each acquisition.
For instance, the following project would be exported as three _.h5oina_ files: one for _Map Data 1_, another for _Map Data 2_ and a final one for _Line Data 1_.
Note that the EDS and EBSD data of the _Map Data 1_ are stored in the same _.h5oina_ file.
_Electron Image 1_ and _Electron Image 2_ are stored in all the _.h5oina_ files.

## File Layout

### <a name="root-level"></a> Root Level Specification

Each file has the following datasets under the root level.

**Dataset Name** | **Mandatory** | **HDF5 Type** | **Dimension (row, column)** | **Comment**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Manufacturer | | H5T_STRING | (1, 1) | i.e. _Oxford Instruments_
Software Version | | H5T_STRING | (1, 1) | Version of software used to create this file
Format Version | yes | H5T_STRING | (1, 1) | Version of this file format
Index | yes | H5T_STRING | (number of slices, 1) | List of the name of the slices (i.e. acquisitions) contained in this file. The attribute **Type** specifies to which type of acquisition the index corresponds to. Possible values are: _Single_ or _Feature_. For particle analysis, the Index corresponds to the index of each feature. <br>:label: Type attribute added in version 5.0

### <a name="slice"></a> Slice Group Specification

:label: Particle analysis acquisition added in version 5.0

Each Slice (i.e. acquisition) has its own H5G_GROUP with the Name of the group as the index of the slice.
The name of all the slices is given in the Index dataset in the root level.
At the moment, _.h5oina_ supports two types of acquisition (see Type attribute of the Index dataset in the root level):

  1. Single acquisition (e.g., EDS map, EBSD map, EBSD line scan, etc.) where only one acquisition is stored per file. The file only contains one Slice, labelled _1_
  2. Particle analysis acquisition where each slice corresponds to one analyzed feature.

Within each Slice group there is at least one Technique group, representing the technique used for the acquisition.
A Slice group can contain several Technique groups.
Note that there is no _Feature_ technique; the particle analysis data and meta-data are stored in the [EDS](#eds) and [Electron Image](#electronimage) techniques.
The techniques can be, but not restrictive to:

**Group Name** | **Mandatory** | **Comment**
--- | --- | ---
[EBSD](#ebsd) | | Contains one EBSD acquisition
[EDS](#eds) | | Contains one EDS acquisition, if there are multiple EDS acquistions e.g. from a multidetector with Unity systems they are numbered EDS1, EDS2 etc. <br>:label: Labelling new in version 6.0

#### <a name="coordinate-systems"></a> Definition of Coordinate Systems

An orientation is quantified by a set of rotations whereby one coordinate system (CS) is rotated to coincidence with another CS.
Depending on the application, it might be desirable to express an orientation relative to a specific CS.
Five coordinate systems are defined:

**CS** | **Name** | **Description**
--- | --- | ---
CSm | Microscope stage | Follows the naming convention from the stage (XY)
CS0 | Sample primary | For a rolled sheet of metal, this would be the rolling, tranverse, normal (RTN) system. In geology this could be the foliation, lineation system seen in some layered rocks.
CS1 | Sample surface | Surface from where we acquire the EBSD measurements
CS2 | Crystal | Follows the convention: Z parallel to c axis of the unit cell, X perpendicular to b and c axes of the unit cell and Y perpendicular to X and Z.
CS3 | EBSD detector | The EBSD detector is position sensitive, in the way that the EBSP changes as we change the position of the detector in the SEM.

The absolute crystal orientation is given by the orientation of the crystal (CS2) to the sample surface (CS1).

### <a name="eds"></a> EDS Technique ###

#### <a name="eds-data"></a> Data Group Specification ####

There will either be one data group labelled EDS or multiple data groups labelled EDS1, EDS2 etc (for multidetector systems including Unity data).

The number of rows (first dimension of array) of all datasets is equal to the size of the acquisition. For example, width x height for maps, length for line scans and 1 for single point.
In other words, it is equal to the total number of pixels in the acquisition.

The EDS Data Group contains at least one of the following groups.

**Group Name** | **Mandatory** | **Comment**

:label: New in version 2.0

#### <a name="electronimage-data"></a> Data Group Specification ####

The Electron Image Data Group contains at least one of the following groups, but may also contain two or all three.
Each group contains one or more datasets corresponding to electron images acquired before, during or after the ED/EBSD acquisition.
There is no requirement for the name of the datasets.
The dataset may take different HDF5 types depending on the depth of the electron images: H5T_NATIVE_UINT8, H5T_NATIVE_UINT16, etc.

The number of rows (first dimension of array) of all datasets is equal to the size of the image (i.e. width x height).
In other words, it is equal to the total number of pixels in the image.
All images in the Data Group have the same dimensions.

**Group Name** | **Mandatory** | **Comment**
--- | --- | ---
SE | | Contains electron image(s) acquired by a secondary electron detector(s)

(e.g., "EDS Layered Image 1" or "EBSD Layered Image 1").
This additional group level is required as each layered image might have different header entries.
#### <a name="layeredimage-data"></a> Data Group Specification ####

The number of rows (first dimension of array) of all datasets is equal to the size of the acquisition.
For example, width x height for maps and length for line scans.

#### <a name="dataprocessing-analyses"></a> Analyses Group Specification ####

The Analyses group contains analysis results obtained by post-processing the EBSD, EDS or Electron Image data.
Each subgroup corresponds to one _type of analysis_ performed with some parameters.
If the same _type of analysis_ was performed with different parameters (e.g. grain identification with different detection angles), the results are stored in different subgroups (e.g. Grain Detection 1, Grain Detection 2).

As the EBSD, EDS and Electron Image techniques, each Analysis contains a Header and Data group.
The Header group contains datasets with the parameters used for the analysis, whereas the Data group contains datasets with the calculated values.
The Header group always contains the following mandatory datasets:

**Dataset Name** | **Mandatory** | **HDF5 Type** | **Dimension (row, column)** | **Comment**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
